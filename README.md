# Titanic_Disaster
This is a solution based on Decision Tree on Titanic disaster project.

My colleauges (@mobaraki, @parvinshahsavand and @Maedeh-Daryanavard) and I presented a new Decision Tree model on Titanic disaster project.
In this code, we consider many approaches in data prepration. 
As the fist project in data science (as Newcomers Data Scietists), I hope our work would be acceptable.

Feel free to contact us in order to any question or suggestion.
Sincerely, 
MajiD
